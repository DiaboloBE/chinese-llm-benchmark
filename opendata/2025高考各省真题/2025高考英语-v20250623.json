    "prompt": "While safety improvements might have been made to our streets in recent years, transport studies also show declines in pedestrian (行人) mobility, especially among young children. Many parents say there’s too much traffic on the roads for their children to walk safely to school, so they pack them into the car instead.\nDutch authors Thalia Verkade and Marco te Brömmelstroet are bothered by facts like these. In their new book *Movement: How to Take Back Our Streets and Transform Our Lives*, they call for a rethink of our streets and the role they play in our lives.\nLife on city streets started to change decades ago. Whole neighbourhoods were destroyed to make way for new road networks and kids had to play elsewhere. Some communities fought back. Most famously, a Canadian journalist who had moved her family to Manhattan in the early 1950s led a campaign to stop the destruction of her local park. Describing her alarm at its proposed replacement with an expressway, Jane Jacobs called on her mayor (市长) to champion “New York as a decent place to live, and not just rush through.” Similar campaigns occurred in Australia in the late 1960s and 1970s as well.\nAlthough these campaigns were widespread, the reality is that the majority of the western cities were completely redesigned around the needs of the motor car. The number of cars on roads has been increasing rapidly. In Australia we now have over twenty million cars for just over twenty-six million people, among the highest rate of car ownership in the world.\nWe invest a lot in roads that help us rush through, but we fail to account for the true costs. Do we really recognise what it costs us as a society when children can’t move safely around our communities? The authors of *Movement* have it right: it’s time to think differently about that street outside your front door.\n\n29. What were the Canadian journalist and other campaigners trying to do?\n（A） Keep their cities livable.\n（B） Promote cultural diversity.\n（C） Help the needy families.\n（D） Make expressways accessible.\n",

    "prompt": "Microplastics have become a common source of pollution across the Earth — they have settled in the deep sea and on the Himalayas, stuck inside volcanic rocks, filled the stomachs of seabirds and even fallen in fresh Antarctic snow. They are even appearing inside humans.\nNow, new research suggests that a simple, cheap measure may significantly reduce the level of microplastics in water from your tap (水龙头): boiling and filtering (过滤) it. In a study published Wednesday in *Environmental Science & Technology Letters*, researchers from China found that boiling tap water for just five minutes — then filtering it after it cools — could remove at least 80 percent of its microplastics.\nCrucially, this process relies on the water containing enough calcium carbonate (碳酸钙) to trap the plastics. In the study, boiling hard water containing 300 milligrams of calcium carbonate led to an almost 90 percent drop in plastics. But in samples with less than 60 milligrams of calcium carbonate, boiling reduced the level of plastics by just 25 percent. Additionally, the research didn’t include all types of plastics. The team focused only on three common types — polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene — and they didn’t study other chemicals previously found in water such as vinyl chloride.\nStill, the findings show a potential path forward for reducing microplastic exposure — a task that’s becoming increasingly difficult. Even bottled water, scientists found earlier this year, contains 10 to 1,000 times more microplastics than originally thought.\nScientists are still trying to determine how harmful microplastics are — but what they do know has raised concerns. The new study suggests boiling tap water could be a tool to limit intake. “The way they demonstrated how microplastics were trapped through the boiling process was nice,” Caroline Gauchotte-Lindsay, an environmental engineer of the University of Glasgow in Scotland who was not involved in the research, tells *New Scientist*. “We should be looking into upgrading drinking water treatment plants so they remove microplastics.”\n\n35. What is Gauchotte-Lindsay’s suggestion about?\n（A） Choice of new research methods.\n（B） Possible direction for further study.\n（C） Need to involve more researchers.\n（D） Potential application of the findings.\n",

But the opposite happened: She was flooded, shipping out 1,200 orders in June of 2020 alone. In the past year, Detrinidad sent out more than 70,000 plants. Her success is just one example of increased time at home leading to an explosion in the houseplant industry.\n“Plants are in fashion right now,” says Dr. Melinda Knuth, a researcher from the University of Florida. “People who live in plant-rich environments report a higher life satisfaction rating,” she says. “Adding more nature to our environment can change our mood and how we think.” Plants can improve our state of mind in a few ways but the biggest is by decreasing our level of cortisol, the stress hormone (激素) in our body.\n“Students who are around plants perform better academically than students who are in a classroom without plants,” says Knuth. “This productivity also translates into the workplace for adults. Our study showed that there was a 30% decrease in sick leave for people who were in plant-rich workplaces.”\nIf you’re among the groups of people who are enjoying the mental and physical health benefits of surrounding yourself with plants, don’t beat yourself up if one (or a few!) doesn’t make it. “Doctors practice medicine and lawyers practice law and you should allow yourself the practice it takes to sustain a plant.

    "prompt": "While safety improvements might have been made to our streets in recent years, transport studies also show declines in pedestrian (行人) mobility, especially among young children. Many parents say there’s too much traffic on the roads for their children to walk safely to school, so they pack them into the car instead.\nDutch authors Thalia Verkade and Marco te Brömmelstroet are bothered by facts like these. In their new book *Movement: How to Take Back Our Streets and Transform Our Lives*, they call for a rethink of our streets and the role they play in our lives.\nLife on city streets started to change decades ago. Whole neighbourhoods were destroyed to make way for new road networks and kids had to play elsewhere. Some communities fought back. Most famously, a Canadian journalist who had moved her family to Manhattan in the early 1950s led a campaign to stop the destruction of her local park. Describing her alarm at its proposed replacement with an expressway, Jane Jacobs called on her mayor (市长) to champion “New York as a decent place to live, and not just rush through.” Similar campaigns occurred in Australia in the late 1960s and 1970s as well.\nAlthough these campaigns were widespread, the reality is that the majority of the western cities were completely redesigned around the needs of the motor car. The number of cars on roads has been increasing rapidly. In Australia we now have over twenty million cars for just over twenty-six million people, among the highest rate of car ownership in the world.\nWe invest a lot in roads that help us rush through, but we fail to account for the true costs. Do we really recognise what it costs us as a society when children can’t move safely around our communities? The authors of *Movement* have it right: it’s time to think differently about that street outside your front door.\n\n30. What can be inferred about the campaigns in Australia in the late 1960s and 1970s?\n（A） They boosted the sales of cars.\n（B） They turned out largely ineffective.\n（C） They won government support.\n（D） They advocated building new parks.\n",

Each has a personality shaped by the goods and services produced and traded for centuries. But each town has more to do than shop.\n<粗体>Hereford, Herefordshire</粗体>\nHereford has remained a lively market town since 1189. Skirting the town square, you’ll find lovely shops, eateries, and the Black and White House Museum. The Hereford Cathedral is the most impressive building in town. It’s also home to an ancient library. One of the four original copies of the Magna Carta is displayed there.\n<粗体>Ludlow, Shropshire</粗体>\nLudlow is known as the Foodie Center of England. Butcher shops, greengrocers, bakeries, and cheese shops line the town square. Bordering the square, the Ludlow Castle is a “must explore” medieval stronghold. The three-day Ludlow Food Festival is held each September.\n<粗体>Shrewsbury, Shropshire</粗体>\nGetting to Shrewsbury Town Center from London is challenging but worth the anxiety. The River Severn has a significant turn through town, almost making an island of Shrewsbury Town Center. The shape creates a perfect market where goods could be shipped and received using the river as a highway. Flowers are everywhere—hanging baskets, window boxes, and planters—just what you imagine in an attractive English market town.\n<粗体>Mevagissey, Cornwall</粗体>\nEven if you haven’t been to the small fishing village Mevagissey, you’ve probably seen it in a movie or British TV show. The working harbor (港口) took shape in 1774. Fishermen go out to sea daily and sell their fish in harbor-side markets. Don’t leave the harbor without a traditional Cornish pie. It’s delicious.\n\n3. What does the author suggest visitors do in Mevagissey?\n（A） Try the Cornish pie.\n（B） Watch a British TV show.\n（C） Go fishing in the sea.\n（D） Take pictures of the harbor.\n",

    "prompt": "While safety improvements might have been made to our streets in recent years, transport studies also show declines in pedestrian (行人) mobility, especially among young children.

Most famously, a Canadian journalist who had moved her family to Manhattan in the early 1950s led a campaign to stop the destruction of her local park. Describing her alarm at its proposed replacement with an expressway, Jane Jacobs called on her mayor (市长) to champion “New York as a decent place to live, and not just rush through.” Similar campaigns occurred in Australia in the late 1960s and 1970s as well.\nAlthough these campaigns were widespread, the reality is that the majority of the western cities were completely redesigned around the needs of the motor car. The number of cars on roads has been increasing rapidly. In Australia we now have over twenty million cars for just over twenty-six million people, among the highest rate of car ownership in the world.\nWe invest a lot in roads that help us rush through, but we fail to account for the true costs. Do we really recognise what it costs us as a society when children can’t move safely around our communities? The authors of *Movement* have it right: it’s time to think differently about that street outside your front door.\n\n28. What phenomenon does the author point out in paragraph 1?\n（A） Cars often get stuck on the road.\n（B） Traffic accidents occur frequently.\n（C） People walk less and drive more.\n（D） Pedestrians fail to follow the rules.\n",

Maybe that feeling comes from growing up in South Africa, where the phrase “there are children starving in Africa” was more of an uncomfortable reminder of fact than a prayer at dinner time.\nFood waste is a growing concern in the restaurant, supermarket, and supply chain industries. From technological solutions to educational campaigns, food producers and sellers are looking for ways to use more of what we’re already growing. But last month, one popular New York City restaurant tried a different way: It changed its menu to exclusively (专门) offer food that would otherwise be thrown away.\nFor two weeks in March, Greenwich Village’s Blue Hill restaurant was renamed wastED, and served items like fried skate cartilage, a juice pulp burger, and a dumpster diver’s vegetable salad. Each dish was tailor-made to raise awareness regarding food waste.\nA study by the Food Waste Alliance determined that the average restaurant generates 33 pounds of food waste for every $1,000 in revenue (收入), and of that waste only 15.7% is donated or recycled. Up to 84.3% is simply thrown out. Restaurants like Silo in the UK have experimented with zero-waste systems, but wastED took the concept to its logical conclusion.\nIt should be noted that none of the items on wastED’s menu was technically made from garbage. Instead, all the ingredients (配料) used were examples of meat cuts and produce that most restaurants would never consider serving. Things like kale ribs, fish collars, rejected sweet potatoes, and cucumber butts were all re-appropriated and, with the help of a number of good chefs, turned into excellent cuisine.\nThough wastED received enthusiastic reviews, it was designed from the start as a short-lived experiment; Blue Hill has since returned to its regular menu. Nevertheless, it serves as a reminder that there are many ways to address problems of sustainability, and that you can make an amazing meal out of almost anything.\n\n14. What is paragraph 5 mainly about?\n（A） Why the ingredients were used.\n（B） Which dishes were best liked.\n（C） What the dishes were made of.\n（D） Where the ingredients were bought.\n",

    "prompt": "Microplastics have become a common source of pollution across the Earth — they have settled in the deep sea and on the Himalayas, stuck inside volcanic rocks, filled the stomachs of seabirds and even fallen in fresh Antarctic snow. They are even appearing inside humans.\nNow, new research suggests that a simple, cheap measure may significantly reduce the level of microplastics in water from your tap (水龙头): boiling and filtering (过滤) it. In a study published Wednesday in *Environmental Science & Technology Letters*, researchers from China found that boiling tap water for just five minutes — then filtering it after it cools — could remove at least 80 percent of its microplastics.\nCrucially, this process relies on the water containing enough calcium carbonate (碳酸钙) to trap the plastics. In the study, boiling hard water containing 300 milligrams of calcium carbonate led to an almost 90 percent drop in plastics. But in samples with less than 60 milligrams of calcium carbonate, boiling reduced the level of plastics by just 25 percent. Additionally, the research didn’t include all types of plastics. The team focused only on three common types — polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene — and they didn’t study other chemicals previously found in water such as vinyl chloride.\nStill, the findings show a potential path forward for reducing microplastic exposure — a task that’s becoming increasingly difficult. Even bottled water, scientists found earlier this year, contains 10 to 1,000 times more microplastics than originally thought.\nScientists are still trying to determine how harmful microplastics are — but what they do know has raised concerns. The new study suggests boiling tap water could be a tool to limit intake. “The way they demonstrated how microplastics were trapped through the boiling process was nice,” Caroline Gauchotte-Lindsay, an environmental engineer of the University of Glasgow in Scotland who was not involved in the research, tells *New Scientist*. “We should be looking into upgrading drinking water treatment plants so they remove microplastics.”\n\n32. How does the author present the issue in the first paragraph?\n（A） By quoting an expert.\n（B） By defining a concept.\n（C） By giving examples.\n（D） By providing statistics.\n",

    "prompt": "C  \nWhen Sonja Detrinidad opened her online shop selling houseplants, she didn’t have high hopes for it. But the opposite happened: She was flooded, shipping out 1,200 orders in June of 2020 alone. In the past year, Detrinidad sent out more than 70,000 plants. Her success is just one example of increased time at home leading to an explosion in the houseplant industry.\n“Plants are in fashion right now,” says Dr. Melinda Knuth, a researcher from the University of Florida. “People who live in plant-rich environments report a higher life satisfaction rating,” she says. “Adding more nature to our environment can change our mood and how we think.” Plants can improve our state of mind in a few ways but the biggest is by decreasing our level of cortisol, the stress hormone (激素) in our body.\n“Students who are around plants perform better academically than students who are in a classroom without plants,” says Knuth. “This productivity also translates into the workplace for adults. Our study showed that there was a 30% decrease in sick leave for people who were in plant-rich workplaces.”\nIf you’re among the groups of people who are enjoying the mental and physical health benefits of surrounding yourself with plants, don’t beat yourself up if one (or a few!) doesn’t make it. “Doctors practice medicine and lawyers practice law and you should allow yourself the practice it takes to sustain a plant. Tending to plants is an exercise in patience and learning. Be invested in taking care of it, but if it dies, go get another one,” Detrinidad says.\n\n9. What is one of Knuth’s findings about plants?\n（A） They appeal more to students.\n（B） They purify the environment.\n（C） They raise the cortisol level.\n（D） They enhance productivity.\n",

    "prompt": "In my ninth-grade writing class last year, I met a cowboy who saved his town, a strict father who demanded his son earn straight A’s, and a modern-day Juliet who died of heartbreak after her parents rejected the love of her young life. More than once, I found myself wondering just how my students, who’d created these people, knew their subjects so well.\nBut things were different for their first essay, which was about the question: “Why is writing important?” Most of the essays filled less than one page, and few contained a sentence that could be interpreted as a thesis (论点) statement. I was shocked. Then I realized that the problem was the question itself. They could have written pages on the necessity of computers, but writing, in and of itself, simply didn’t strike them as important. This would have to change.\nAs a new unit started, I asked everyone to write a persuasive piece on a health-related topic of their choice. This time they found the exercise much more interesting. For the next two assignments, a personal-narrative unit followed by a creative-writing workshop, I only required that the piece meet the specifications of its genre (体裁) and that it contain a thesis. The results were <下划线>staggering</下划线>. The students took on diverse topics and turned in stories, 10 to 20 pages each, with characters that broadened my view and touched my heart.\nI walked into class believing that writing is important as a means of communication. However, my students demonstrated something more important to me. When the final bell rang in June, I walked away with a yearbook full of messages about writing’s most powerful significance—the ability to connect people, to put us in another’s skin, to teach us what it means to be human.\n\n25. Why did the students perform poorly in writing their first essay?\n（A） They were not given enough time.\n（B） They had a very limited vocabulary.\n（C） They misunderstood the question.\n（D） They had little interest in the topic.\n",

    "prompt": "While safety improvements might have been made to our streets in recent years, transport studies also show declines in pedestrian (行人) mobility, especially among young children. Many parents say there’s too much traffic on the roads for their children to walk safely to school, so they pack them into the car instead.\nDutch authors Thalia Verkade and Marco te Brömmelstroet are bothered by facts like these.
